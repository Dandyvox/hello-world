# hello-world
My first repository.

If there is a level below amateur developer, that would be me. I'm a total newbie to web developement, but I can already tell that I'm going to enjoy learning. When I'm not learning how to write code, I produce music with my friend, go on dates with my girlfriend and watch a lot of videos on YouTube haha. I used to play soccer and go to the gym often, but I haven't had the time to do that lately due to my busy work schedule. Anyways, I think that's enough about me without getting too personal, peace.
